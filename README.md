# Airline_Delay_Analysis_Bigdata
Analyze the departure delay of different airline carriers using Python's Scikit-learn machine learning packages

Tasks Performed to complete project deliverables:
-------------------------------------------------
1] Pre-processing of raw dataset  
2] Reducing the dataset using Pig  
3] Classification of delayed airline records using Python's Scikit-learn machine learning packages  
4] Performance comparison of different Scikit-learn machine learning packages  
5] Calculation of different airline delays in percentage  

Scikit-learn packages used for classification of delay records:
---------------------------------------------------------------
1] LogisticRegression  
2] RandomForestClassifier  
3] AdaBoostClassifier  
4] VotingClassifier  
5] GradientBoostingClassifier  
6] ExtraTreesClassifier  

Delay records of the following airlines were analyzed:
------------------------------------------------------
1] American Airlines [AA]  
2] Delta Airlines [DL]  
3] JetBlue Airlines [B6]  
4] United Airlines [UA]  
5] Virgin America [VX]  

See FinalReport.pdf for more details.

The modules are organized as seperate directories. To execute a particular module copy the cells in a module to IPython Notebook cells in order. Before copying the cells, copy the reduced dataset to the local system. 

For example, to execute Delay_Percentage execute the following steps:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

step 1: Download the project zip file and unzip it  
step 2: Copy the Datasets directory to the local system  
step 3: Execute "ipython notebook" from ubuntu terminal (or other compatible platforms) from the directory to which we have copied the Datasets  
step 4: Copy the contents of files inside Delay_Percentage to ipython notebook cells in order and execute them as you copy
